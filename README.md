# Concentration

Memorize the locations of the cards in the game and to make pairs of cards by turning them over 2 by 2. When the 2 cards match, it's a pair! You win the pair and have the right to play again, otherwise the cards are automatically turned face down and you have to make a new try.

For the "SOLO" mode, the purpose of the matching game is to find all the pairs in the least moves and in a shortest time.
In the 2 players mode: the player who finds the most pairs wins.
